st.markdown("""
This is a live demo of an **Agentic AI** system that automates GCP IAM security audits.

You describe what you want in plain English — the Agent figures out which GCP APIs to call,
executes them in sequence, reasons about the results, and produces a structured audit report.
No scripting. No manual API calls.

---

### Why this exists

Most IAM audit tools are scripts that run a fixed set of checks.
This demo shows a different model: a **reasoning agent** that can adapt its approach based on what it finds.

> "Find service accounts with owner-level access and check if any of them have been
> inactive for more than 90 days" — that kind of flexible, multi-step query is where
> agents shine over fixed scripts.
